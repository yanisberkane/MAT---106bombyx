# Mathematics - 106bombyx Project
Language: Python

In the 70’s, chaos theory opened the way for a better understanding of the evolution of some animal species. Butterflys for instance. Let’s look at... bombyx.

If a generation is crowded, chances are that the next generation will be crowded too, regarding the natural rules of reproduction. But resources may lack for this new generation, so it may not be able to develop.

Therefore, the number of bombyx depends on those two contradictory factors, and its evolution is far from trivial.

In order to study this evolution, there are two things:
  - The curve representing the number of individuals in relation to the generation (varying from 1 to 100);
  - A synthetic scheme summing all the results for a given n; it consists in plotting every value of xi (between two given bounds), in relation to k (k varying from 1 to 4 by 0.01 steps).

In both cases, your program shall print on the standard outuput the values to be entered into gnuplot to draw the graphs.
